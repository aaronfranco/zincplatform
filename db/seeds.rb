Product.create! id: 1, name: "b3 Guitars Phoenix V Korina", price: 4200.00, description:"Gene Baker, former Master Builder at the Gibson and Fender Custom Shops, has moved his b3 Guitars from California to the brand new, state of the art, Roscoe Guitars workshop in North Carolina. Once again, he is making his SL, Phoenix, and Ring Master models by hand, with top quality materials, and true to his designs. This Phoenix V is the absolute best example of the model we've every played.\n\nThe Phoenix is a combination of many classic guitar design elements that result in a unique and wonderful instrument. Fundamentally, this is a 25.5inch scale, neck thru solid-body guitar with string thru body and angled headstock, all of which accentuate energy transfer and resonance. The look and the feel of the Phoenix is inspired by the best features of the Tele, Firebird, Strat, and Les Paul.\n\nThe Phoenix can be ordered with a wide variety of electronics and bridges. This Phoenix V has Mean Gene's original design of two Lollar mini humbuckers and a Tele singlecoil on a 5-way switch with master volume and tone. This balanced combination is mated with a full-size and extra mass Tele 3-barrel bridge for pronounced sonic character.\n\nThe V designation indicates this guitar is upgraded with creme bound neck and deluxe trapezoid fret markers. This guitar also has a clean (i.e. not aged), full body and neck TV Yellow finish that is super thin and beautifully translucent with a well matched tortoise shell pickguard. The most striking element of this guitar is its premium Korina body and neck."
